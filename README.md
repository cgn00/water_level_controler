# Water Level Controller

Water Level Controller is a system for automatically controlling the water level in a tank using Arduino microcontroller. It provides a platform for controlling the water pump and sensors to maintain the desired water level.

## Installation

To use the Water Level Controller system, you will need an Arduino board, a water pump, and water level sensors. Clone this repository onto your computer and upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Water Level Controller can be used to control the water level in any tank, from small household tanks to large industrial tanks. The Arduino board serves as the main controller, while the water pump and sensors are connected to it.

The code provided in this repository includes basic examples for controlling the water pump and reading sensor data. These examples can be modified and expanded upon to create more complex water level control behaviors.
