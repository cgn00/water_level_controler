# Water Level Controller

Water Level Controller is a system for automatically controlling the water level in a tank using an Arduino microcontroller and a PID controller. It provides a platform for controlling the water pump and sensors to maintain the desired water level.

## Installation

To use the Water Level Controller system, you will need an Arduino board, a water pump, water level sensors, and a PID library. Clone this repository onto your computer and upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Water Level Controller can be used to control the water level in any tank, from small household tanks to large industrial tanks. The Arduino board serves as the main controller, while the water pump and sensors are connected to it.

The code provided in this repository includes examples for controlling the water pump and reading sensor data using a PID controller. The PID controller is used to calculate the error between the desired water level and the actual water level, and adjust the pump accordingly to maintain the desired level.

To calibrate the PID controller, you will need to adjust the proportional, integral, and derivative gains until the system responds accurately to changes in water level. This can be done by trial and error or using an autotuning algorithm.
